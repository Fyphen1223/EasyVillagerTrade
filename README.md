# **EasyVillagerTrade**


Tired of trading all day with a librarian?  
**EasyVillagerTrade** is a client-side fabric mod for minecraft which helps you to trade your desired book.  
Just take some lecterns in your off-hand and an axe in your main hand.

---
### Command
1. Start by selecting the villager and his lectern, using ``/evt select``\
    then right-click the villager and the lectern
2. Select your desired books using ``/evt search add <maxPrice> <enchantment> (<level>)``
3. Use ``/evt execute`` to start the search

<br/>

**You may also use:**
1. ``/evt search <remove/list>`` to remove any entry or list them all
2. ``/evt stop`` to stop the search

<br/>

#### Custom Screen:
Are you to lazy to always type the commands? \
You can simply press ```F6``` to open the custom screen where you can easily add / remove your wishes


---
### Upcoming features
- [X] Interrupt search when durability is low
* [ ] Allow user to write tiny scripts that are executed (e.g. player walks 2 blocks to the right after a trade was successful)
- [X] Add GUI (mostly done)
---

Note that while using this mod there will be a loss of lecterns. \
This construction will collect and spit out all items that were dropped too far away from the player
